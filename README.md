# OpenSourceMate

[![CI](https://github.com/Muskankr/OpenSourceMate/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Muskankr/OpenSourceMate/actions/workflows/ci.yml)


> **Find open-source opportunities that match your skills.**

OpenSourceMate is an AI-powered open-source contribution discovery platform that analyzes a developer's public GitHub profile and technical experience to help identify meaningful contribution opportunities.

The project is being developed with a focus on making open-source contribution discovery easier for developers and newcomers.

---

## ✨ Current Features

### 🔎 GitHub Profile Analysis

Enter a public GitHub username and OpenSourceMate retrieves useful profile information such as:

* GitHub username
* Name and bio
* Public repository count
* Followers and following
* Link to the GitHub profile

### 🧠 Technical Skill Analysis

OpenSourceMate analyzes the user's public GitHub repositories to identify technical skills and shows:

* Detected technologies/languages
* Repository count associated with each skill
* Skill distribution
* Number of repositories analyzed

### 🎯 Contribution Discovery — Coming Next

The next stage of OpenSourceMate is focused on connecting a developer's technical profile with open GitHub issues.

Planned capabilities include:

* Skill-based issue matching
* Personalized issue recommendations
* Contribution compatibility analysis
* Beginner-friendly issue discovery
* Repository and issue context
* Contribution opportunity ranking

> Features marked as planned are part of the project's roadmap and may not be available yet.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend

* Next.js
* React
* TypeScript
* Tailwind CSS

### Backend

* Python
* Django
* Django REST Framework

### AI / Data

The backend is being developed with an AI/data ecosystem that includes technologies such as:

* Google GenAI
* OpenAI-compatible tooling
* Sentence Transformers
* Transformers
* spaCy
* PyTorch

### Developer & Integration Tools

* GitHub APIs
* GitPython
* REST APIs

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* Git
* Node.js
* npm
* Python 3.x

---

## 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Muskankr/OpenSourceMate.git
cd OpenSourceMate
```

---

## 2. Run the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # Configure API URL (default: http://localhost:8000)
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

---

## 3. Run the backend

Open a second terminal:

```bash
cd backend
```

Create and activate a virtual environment:

### Windows

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### macOS / Linux

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Configure environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # Add GitHub token, AI API key if needed
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then start the backend using the project's configured Django development entry point.

> Backend setup is currently evolving. More detailed setup instructions and environment configuration will be documented as the project develops.

---

## 🔐 Environment Variables

If a feature requires external services or API credentials, configure them through environment variables rather than committing secrets to the repository.

Each package includes a `.env.example` file with all supported variables. Copy the example file and fill in your values:

### Frontend (`frontend/.env.local`)

```bash
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.local
```

```env
# Backend API URL (required for API calls)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### Backend (`backend/.env`)

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

```env
# GitHub API Token (optional, for higher rate limits)
# GITHUB_TOKEN=

# AI Configuration (optional, for AI-powered issue analysis)
# AI_API_KEY=
# AI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini

# Server Configuration
# HOST=0.0.0.0
# PORT=8000
```

**Never commit API keys, passwords, tokens, or other secrets to Git.**

## 🧩 How It Works

The current workflow is:

```text
                GitHub Username
                       │
                       ▼
              GitHub Profile API
                       │
                       ▼
             Profile Information
                       │
                       ▼
            Public Repositories
                       │
                       ▼
             Technical Analysis
                       │
                       ▼
                Skill Profile
                       │
                       ▼
        Contribution Discovery
             (Roadmap)
```

The planned contribution-discovery layer will extend this pipeline:

```text
Developer Profile
       │
       ▼
Technical Skills
       │
       ▼
Open GitHub Issues
       │
       ▼
Compatibility Analysis
       │
       ▼
Personalized Opportunities
```

## 📚 Project Vision

Open-source contribution can be difficult to navigate, especially for developers who are unsure:

* Which projects match their skills?
* Which issues are suitable for their experience?
* How difficult is an issue?
* What does a repository actually need?
* Where should they start?

OpenSourceMate aims to reduce that discovery barrier by connecting a developer's existing technical experience with meaningful open-source contribution opportunities.
